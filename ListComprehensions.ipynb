    "Ever think your code was too clunky? That your *for* loop has gotten out of hand? There's a comprehension for that! \n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are a more efficient and faster iteration alternative to the standard *for* loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pros:\n",
    "    1. Less coding - what can usually take 3 - 4 lines (or more) can usually be done in one.\n",
    "    2. Performance - A comprehension's interations are performed at C language speeds in the interpreter so it's often at least two times faster than the standard *for* loop. This is a huge and noticeable performance difference when working with large data sets. \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a standard for loop to iterate over a list and add 10 to each element. "

    "A list comprehension doesn't just stop at performing an operation on a list, it *creates a new list object*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that in the list comprehension, there's no \"range\" or \"len\" used. It's not necessary. Comprehensions are smarter than your average *for* loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"L = \"** <--- we're giving the new list object a name, in this instance, we're writing over the content of the original list \"L\" with the results of the comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"[x + 10...]\"** <--- performing the operation on the elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"[...for x in L]\"** <--- iterating over the elements in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wait, what?\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax may take a little getting used to. If you look at the expression in the beginning of the comprehension (x + 10), you're performing an operation on something that hasn't been declared yet. X? What is X? This isn't math, I don't want to solve for x. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's not until the end of the comprehension, in the *for* loop, that you see x is the variable representing each element in the list. A comprehension is basically a backwards *for* loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "### List Comprehensions and Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating over a file just got easier!\n",
    "\n",
